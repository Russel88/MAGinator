# MAGinator

Combining the strengths of contig and gene based methods to provide:

* Accurate abundances of species using de novo signature genes
    * MAGinator uses a statistical model to find the best genes for calculating accurate abundances
* SNV-level resolution phylogenetic trees based on signature genes
    * MAGinator creates a phylogenetic tree for each species so you can associate your metadata with subspecies/strain level differences
* Connect accessory genome to the species annotation by getting a taxonomic scope for gene clusters
    * MAGinator clusters all ORFs into gene clusters and for each gene cluster you will know which taxonomic level it is specific to
* Improve your functional annotation by grouping your genes in synteny clusters based on genomic adjacency
    * MAGinator clusters gene clusters into synteny clusters - Syntenic genes are usually part of the same pathway or have similar functions 

## Installation

All you need for running MAGinator is snakemake and mamba. Other dependencies will be installed by snakemake automatically.

```sh
conda create -n maginator -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake mamba
conda activate maginator
pip install maginator
```

Furthermore, MAGinator also needs the GTDB-tk database version R207_v2 downloaded. If you don't already have it, you can run the following:
```sh
wget https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release207/207.0/auxillary_files/gtdbtk_r207_v2_data.tar.gz
tar xvzf gtdbtk_v2_data.tar.gz
```

## Usage

MAGinator needs 3 input files:

* The clusters.tsv files from [VAMB](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb)
* A fasta file with sequences of all contigs, with unique names
* A comma-separated file giving the position of the fastq files with your sequencing reads formatted as: SampleName,PathToForwardReads,PathToReverseReads

Run MAGinator:
```sh
maginator -v vamb_clusters.tsv -r reads.csv -c contigs.fasta -o my_output -g "/path/to/GTDB-Tk/database/release207_v2/"
```

A testset can be found in the test_data directory. 
1. Download the 3 samples used for the test at SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?LinkName=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=715601 with the ID's dfc99c_A, f9d84e_A and 221641_A
2. Change the paths to the read-files in reads.csv
3. Unzip the contigs.fasta.gz 
4. Run MAGinator

### Run on a compute cluster
MAGinator can run on compute clusters using qsub (torque), sbatch (slurm), or drmaa structures. The --cluster argument toggles the type of compute cluster infrastructure. The --cluster_info argument toggles the information given to the submission command, and it has to contain the following keywords {cores}, {memory}, {runtime}, which are used to forward resource information to the cluster.

A qsub MAGinator can for example be run with the following command (... indicates required arguments, see above):
```sh
maginator ... --cluster qsub --cluster_info "-l nodes=1:ppn={cores}:thinnode,mem={memory}gb,walltime={runtime}"
```

## Test data

A test set can be found in the maginator/test_data directory. 
1. Download the 3 samples used for the test at SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?LinkName=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=715601 with the ID's dfc99c_A, f9d84e_A and 221641_A
2. Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/Russel88/MAGinator.git
3. Change the paths to the read-files in reads.csv
4. Unzip the contigs.fasta.gz 
5. Run MAGinator

MAGinator has been run on the test data on a slurm server with the following command:
```sh
maginator --vamb_clusters clusters.tsv --reads reads.csv --contigs contigs.fasta --gtdb_db data/release207_v2/ --output test_out --cluster slurm --cluster_info "-n {cores} --mem {mem_gb}gb -t {runtime}" --max_mem 180
```
The expected output can be found as a zipped file on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8279036

## Recommended workflow 

To generate the input files to run MAGinator we have created a recommended workflow, with preprocessing, assembly and binning* of your metagenomics reads (the rules for binning have been copied from VAMB (https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb/blob/master/workflow/)). 
It has been setup as a snakefile in recommended_workflow/reads_to_bins.Snakefile.

The input to the workflow is the reads.csv file. The workflow can be run using snakemake:
```
snakemake --use-conda -s reads_to_bins.Snakefile --resources mem_gb=180 --config reads=reads.csv --cores 10 --printshellcmds 
```

Preparing data for MAGinator run
```
sed 's/@/_/g' assembly/all_assemblies.fasta > all_assemblies.fasta
sed 's/@/_/g' vamb/clusters.tsv > clusters.tsv
```

Now you are ready to run MAGinator.

## Functional Annotation

To generate the functional annotation of the genes we recommend using EggNOG mapper (https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper).

You can download it and try to run it on the test data
```sh
mkdir test_out/functional_annotation
emapper.py -i test/genes/all_genes_rep_seq.fasta --output test_out/functional_annotation -m diamond --cpu 38
```

The eggNOG output can be merged with clusters.tsv and further processed to obtain functional annotations of the MAG, cluster or sample levels with the following command:
```sh
(echo -e '#sample\tMAG_cluster\tMAG\tfunction'; join -1 1 -2 1 <(awk '{print $2 "\t" $1}' clusters.tsv | sort) <(tail -n +6 annotations.tsv | head -n -3 | cut -f1,15 | grep -v '\-$' | sed 's/_[[:digit:]]\+\t/\t/' | sed 's/,/\n/g' | perl -lane '{$q = $F[0] if $#F > 0; unshift(@F, $q) if $#F == 0}; print "$F[0]\t$F[1]"' | sed 's/\tko:/\t/' | sort) | awk '{print $2 "\t" $2 "\t" $3}' | sed 's/_/\t/' | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n) > MAGfunctions.tsv
```
In this case the KEGG ortholog column 15 was picked from the eggNOG-mapper output. But by cutting e.g. column number 13, one would obtain GO terms instead. Refer to the header of the eggNOG-mapper output for other available functional annotations e.g. KEGG pathways, Pfam, CAZy, COGs, etc.


## MAGinator workflow

This is what MAGinator does with your input (if you want to see all parameters run maginator --help):
* Filter bins by size
    * Use --binsize to control the cutoff
* Run GTDB-tk to taxonomically annotate bins and call open reading frames (ORFs)
* Group your VAMB clusters into metagenomic species (MGS) based on the taxonomic annotation. (Unannotated VAMB clusters are kept in the pipeline, but left unchanged)
    * Use --no_mgs to disable this
    * Use --annotation_prevalence to change how prevalent an annotation has to be in a VAMB cluster to call taxonomic consensus
* Cluster your ORFs into gene clusters to get a non-redundant gene catalogue
    * Use --clustering_min_seq_id to toggle the clustering identity
    * Use --clustering_coverage to toggle the clustering coverage
    * Use --clustering_type to toggle whether to cluster on amino acid or nucleotide level
* Map reads to the non-redundant gene catalogue and create a matrix with gene counts for each sample
* Pick non-redundant genes that are only found in one MGS each
* Fit signature gene model and use the resulting signature genes to get the abundance of each MGS
* Prepare for generation of phylogenies for each MGS by finding outgroups and marker genes which will be used for rooting the phylogenies
* Use the read mappings to collect SNV information for each signature gene and marker gene for each sample
* Align signature and marker genes, concatenate alignments and infer phylogenetic trees for each MGS
    * Use --phylo to toggle whether use fasttree (fast, approximate) or iqtree (slow, precise) to infer phylogenies
* Infer the taxonomic scope of each gene cluster. That is, at what taxonomic level are genes from a given gene cluster found in
    * Use --tax_scope_threshold to toggle the threshold for how to find the taxonomic scope consensus
* Cluster gene clusters into synteny clusters based on how often they are found adjacent on contigs
